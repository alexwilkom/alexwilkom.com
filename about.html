        <h3>Who is Alex? Where does he live? What does he do?</h3>
        <p>His name is Alex. And he is a <strong>practical dreamer.</strong> Dreams are abstract and sometimes even difficult to believe they could happen at all. But, he has made the decision, not a long time ago, of creating and practicing in real life the events of his favourite dream.</p>

        <p>We could say, with certainty, that at the age of 30, there is still an important amount of <strong>faith</strong> in him, with the addition of an equal important value: <strong>perseverance.</strong> Despite difficulties encountered along his path, he has finally understood that passion comes after repetitive and deliberate hard and deep work. All of this while living in Spain, Italy, United Kingdom and now back to Italy, throughout his life.</p>

        <p>He is grateful to have worked in an airline company flying all over Europe, as a cabin crew. Thanks to this working position, in the last few months he had time to replicate the events of his dream, as accurately and as much as he could. And now that he left behind the art of flying and is finally fully focusing in the practices of his dream, he has become the limit of himself.</p>

        <!-- Another paragraph describing what you'd like to do in web design and development -->
        <h3>What would he like to do in Web Development?</h3>
        <p>Web development is the medium through which he can embrace his ideas and values and apply them and show them to the world. In other words, web development allows him to show that he is another <strong>artist among artists.</strong></p>

        <p>There are three values that drive his ideas in their good-enough-final shape, and the same values that always drive improvement after it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Simplicity</li>
            <li>Efficiency</li>
            <li>Beauty</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What are his passions?</h3>
        <p>His passions are coding, reading classics and science and sci-fi books, LEGO and robots.</p>
