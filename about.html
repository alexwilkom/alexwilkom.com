        <h3>Who am I? Where do I live? What do I do?</h3>
        <p>My name is Alex. And I am a practical dreamer. Dreams are abstract and sometimes even difficult to believe
            they could happen at all. But, I made the decision, not a long time ago, of creating and practicing in real
            life the events of my favourite dream.</p>

        <p>We could say, with certainty, that at the age of 30, there is still an important amount of faith in me, with
            the addition of an equal important value: perseverance. Despite challenges encountered along the path, I
            have finally understood that passion comes after repetitive and deliberate hard and deep work. All of this
            while living in Spain, Italy, United Kingdom and now back to Italy, throughout my life.</p>
        <!-- 
        <p>I am grateful to have worked in an airline company flying all over Europe, as a cabin crew. Thanks to this working position, in the last few months I had time to replicate the events of my dream, as accurately and as much as I could. And now that I left behind the art of flying and am finally fully focusing in the practices of my dream, I have become the limit of myself.</p> -->


        <h3>What would I like to do in Web Development?</h3>
        <p>Web development is the medium through which I believe I can embrace my ideas and values and apply them and
            show them to the world. In other words, web development allows me to show that I try to be another artist
            among artists.</p>

        <!-- <p>There are three values that drive his ideas in their good-enough-final shape, and the same values that always drive improvement after it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Simplicity</li>
            <li>Efficiency</li>
            <li>Beauty</li>
        </ol> -->

        <h3>What are my passions?</h3>
        <p>My passions are coding, reading - which includes classics, science and sci-fi books - LEGO and robots.</p>


        <h3>What is my favourite quote?</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <p>"In the minds of geniuses we discover our own neglected thoughts."</p>
            <cite>Ralph Waldo Emerson</cite>
        </blockquote>

        <p>But pretty much all of <a href="https://www.azquotes.com/author/4490-Ralph_Waldo_Emerson"
                target="_blank">Ralph Waldo Emerson's quotes</a> are worth reading.</p>
